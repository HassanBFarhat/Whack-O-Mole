# Whack-O-Mole

This is a final project for Java II course and it's a whack-o-mole game with a twist. The user will play a normal Whack-O-Mole game, but will have to avoid the added randomized bombs that pop up on the game board. The user will have 3 lives to start with, if the user hits the bomb it's instant elimination, otherwise if the user hits the mole points are gained, if the user misses a mole, then some points are lost. Goal of the game is to get the highest score and not lose all 3 lives.

First part of the game is a start screen that displays the name of the game "Whack-O-Mole" with a play button to start the game

After starting the game, the actual game grid (4x3) appears and either the mole or bomb will randomly pop out from one of the holes in the game grid. The top of this screen displays the current score and the lives left of the player.

Once a player either hits a bomb or loses all 3 lives, the game over screen is displayed and it displays to the user their final score.
